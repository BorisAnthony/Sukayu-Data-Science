## 2. Derived statistical data
Statistical data derived by us (*[Boris Anthony](https://github.com/BorisAnthony)* [^5]) using our own devices, code and logic.

This statistical data is made available here in two forms:
- A zipped, tab-delimited CSV file: **[“Sukayu-Winters-Data.csv.zip”](https://github.com/BorisAnthony/Sukayu-Data-Science/blob/main/outputs/derived/Sukayu-Winters-Data.csv.zip)** [^6]
