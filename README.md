# Sukayu Seasonal Weather Observations Analysis

This project analyses various databases of historical weather observation data from the JMA (Japan Meteorological Association) station at Sukayu Onsen, Aomori, Japan.

As one of the oldest offical weather stations in Japan, and also at the foot of the Hakkoda Mountains, known to be one of the snowiest places in the country, we hope to glean some trends in the effects of climate change on the area's winter mountain sport seasons.
